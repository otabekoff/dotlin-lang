# Dotlin Implementation Tasks

## Phase 1-12: Completed Milestones ✅

- [x] Standard Library (Math, File I/O, Date/Time)
- [x] Language Features (Classes, Inheritance, Constructors, Try-Catch)
- [x] Collections (Arrays, map, filter, structural equality)
- [x] Core Architecture (Binary arithmetic, structural equality, full lexer interpolation)

## Phase 13: Error Handling & Debugging (Current Priority)

- [ ] **Comprehensive Error Messages**:

## Phase 13: Error Handling & Debugging (Completed) ✅

- [x] Specialized Errors with Location ✅
- [x] Stack Trace implementation ✅
- [x] Debugging utilities (printStackTrace) ✅

## Phase 14: Type System Finalization ✅
- [x] Functional Type Inference for variables
- [x] Type Resolution for functions and built-ins
- [x] Integrated static analysis pass

## Phase 15: Performance Optimizations (Current Priority) 🚀
- [/] **Constant Folding**:
  - [ ] Implement `ConstantFolder` visitor to evaluate expressions like `2 + 2` at compile-time.
  - [ ] Apply folding to literal math and string concatenation.
- [ ] **Environment Optimization**:
  - [ ] Measure and improve environment lookup performance.

## Phase 16: Advanced Kotlin Features & Compatibility
- [ ] **Extension Functions**: `fun Type.name()`
- [ ] **Null Safety**: `?`, `!!`, `?.`
- [ ] **Generics**: Full enforcement in static analysis.
